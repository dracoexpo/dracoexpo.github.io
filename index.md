### About
The idea of Memento is to provide a fun learning service for students of all ages. With Memento students can create and share flashcards, quizzes and study materials such as notes and solution suggestions. 

### Why?
As university students we all appreciate simple and fun ways to learn. Flashcards and quizzes are some of the best and fastest ways to learn and memorize any type of information which is why we wanted to create Memento. In Memento we collect all the learning methods we find useful, not only flashcards and quizzes but also the ability to upload and share your notes. The idea is to provide a crowdsourced platform where everyone can access anything uploaded by anyone.

### How? 
To develop Memento we used [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/), which is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Android app development. Android Studio has built-in tools for the design of your app but we wanted more options, so we used [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/se/products/xd.html), which is a collaborative platform that helps you create designs for mobile apps, websites and more. Because sharing and re-doing your flashcards and quizzes was the main feature intended for the app, we needed a database to store what the app's users uploaded. We used [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), which is a service that provides a real-time database that allows application data to be stored on Firebase's cloud and to be synchronized across clients.

### How it works
* Memento requires you to have an account. You create your account when you first open the app.
* The feed collects and shows trending flashcards, quizzes and notes. What is trending is determined by the number of likes. Items with the most likes show up first.
* You can create and share your own flashcards, quizzes and notes by pressing the "+" button.
* You can also edit and remove what you've uploaded and change your profile picture from your profile page.
* By pressing the search button, you can search for flashcards, quizzes and notes by entering suitable keywords. You can also access other people's profiles from the search page.
