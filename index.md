### Welcome to the Expo  <img width='3%' src="hatt.png?raw=true"/> 

This is the website for Draco's project. Here we have information about our app Memento which is a study oriented application aimed to help students of all ages. With Memento students can create and share flashcards, quizzes and study materials such as notes and solution suggestions. Checkout the project tab for more information about how we worked.

Below there is a link to a zoom meeting where you can ask us questions. The zoom meeting is open from 11-13 19th of May 2020. You can also checkout our video tutorial where we demonstrate the app.
